Measuring and Promoting Diversity in Evolutionary Algorithms
============================================================

While *divergence  of  character* is  a  cornerstone  of  the  Darwinian  theory  of  natural  evolution,  the lack  of divergence is  an  oppressive  burden  of  artificial  evolution.  The  problem  has  been  sometimes  labeled  with the oxymoron "premature convergence", implying that the algorithms would converge to better solutions if prevented  from  exploiting  strongly  attractive  local  optima.  Different  names  have  been  given  by  different researchers, and different effects have been observed on different paradigms. Almost all deleterious.

The goal of "Measuring and Promoting Diversity in Evolutionary Algorithms" (MPDEA) workshops is to show the current lines of research in the fields of  both diversity promotion and measurement,  as  illustrated  by  their  own  authors.  We  would  be  happy  if MPDEA  would  give  its attendees  the  opportunity  to  dive  into  this  important  and  open problem,  first  providing  them  with background information and eventually enabling them to present their bleeding-edge ideas.

The  MPDEA's call for  papers also  included *a call for references*,  where  we  asked  scholars  to  pinpoint any interesting  contribution  already  published.  Thanks  to  the  replies,  we  are  proud  to  add  an  updated bibliography on diversity promotion to the material of the workshop.
